# Chap-8
This covers chapter 8 for Java, classes, but not polymorphism.

TicTacToe is a class-based project, using Board and Player. You can play with multiple players with an adjustable board size, number in a row to win,  and number of pieces on the board allowed at once per player. 

The rest are just exercises.
