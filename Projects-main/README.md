# Projects
Projects small and large.

ArrayListABC: Each letter (capitilized iirc) in an array does certain things when iterating through it.

TicTacToe, Board, and Player go together. It's a customizable Tic-Tac-Toe where you can customize LxW of the board, number of players, number of pieces(?) on the board at a time, number of pieces needed to win. Because of the customizable nature of the project, there'll sometimes be issues when checking the diagnols for a win. I didn't have enough time to fix and update it because of school demands.

Pascal Triangles Methods 1-4 are different ways to make a pascal triangle.

Transporter: Start with x amount of money, go to the five regions(?) (The Atlantic Eastern Central Mountain Pacific). The time you input will update as you go back and forth through the regions in addition to the money.

Long_Distance: Calculates the price of a fake long distance call depending on the day of the week, and time. 

Find Pairs: Takes an array of integers and determines if there is a pair of the integer parameter in the array. Doesn't seem much like a project now that I look at it.

Magic Square: This was done a long time ago and could probably use improvements. As it says, it takes integer x and generates a magic square.

Memory Match: Generates an array of pairs of numbers for two players to try to guess. Could use some trimming.

Master Mind: Just the game master mind. 

Horoscope:Considered this a project because I spent 2 hour trying to figure where to begin and how to use jsoup. This is a bare bones and my first attempt at webscraping.
It will print out whatever the current reading for your sign is off of astrology . com. If not, it will help you calculate which sign you are. There probably is an issue with the appropriate days allowed depending on the month.
